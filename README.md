# Water Filter
A DIY water filter for water features/fountains etc

I made my own after inheriting a water feature full of sludge â˜¹


## Requirements

- Water pump (I'm using a DC pump so it can be run via battery or AC)
- Platic container (eg a 1.25L bottle)
- Pantihose or similar 
- (Optional) some mesh


### Power

I'm using 18V Ryobi batteries, but you can run a pump off AC using a power brick. 

Reasons I chose batteries (Ryobi):
- You can buy an adapter to attach leads to (plug and play) - pic below
- They're easy to recharge (no alligator clips, they use your Ryobi charger)
- They're readily available and can be used in your cordless tools
- They have a handy "fuel" gauge so you don't need a multimeter to check their voltage ðŸ”‹
- You can buy low or high capacity varieties
- Handy if you don't have AC nearby or can't weatherproof it âš¡

### Mesh

- This was added after the pump was sucking in the pantihose ðŸ¤£


## Instructions

- Drill a hole in the bottle cap for the pump input
- Insert the pump, add electrical/thread tape for a good seal
- Cut mesh to size and place in the bottle
- Apply the pantihose
- Connect the power source to the contraption
- Collect the sludge and wash out the pantihose
- Enjoy
