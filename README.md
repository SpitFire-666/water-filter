# Water Filter
A DIY water filter for water features/fountains etc


## Requirements

- Water pump (I'm using a DC pump so it can be run via battery or AC)
- Platic container (eg a 1.25L bottle)
- Pantihose or similar
- (Optional) some mesh


### Power

I'm using 18V Ryobi batteries, for a couple reasons:
- You can buy an adapter to attach leads to (plug and play) - pic below
- They're easy to recharge (no alligator clips or custom charger required)
- They're readily available and can be used in your cordless tools
- They have a handy "fuel" gauge so you don't need a multimeter to check their voltage
- You can buy low or high capacity variations
